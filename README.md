# dupfinder
Inspired by [duplicate-files](https://github.com/thorsummoner/duplicate-files/blob/master/DuplicateFiles.py). Helps find and manage potentially duplicate files on your computer, only searches the top level of a directory for now and currently uses a lot of memory.

## Usage
Call dupfinder on your command line and specify any of these commands:
* -dir - The directory to scan for duplicate files
* -to - The directory to move duplicate files to
